The Intake process begins when a user or customer submits a support request through one of the available channels, such as email, web form, or a customer portal. osTicket automatically creates a new ticket based on the information provided by the user. This includes details like the user's name, contact information, and a description of the issue or request. During the Intake step, the ticket can be assigned various attributes, such as a unique ticket number, creation date and time.
